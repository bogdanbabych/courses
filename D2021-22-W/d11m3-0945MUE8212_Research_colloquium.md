##### Course description

In a modern working environment, translators need skills for systematic analysis and interpretation of data, such as textual information or corpus-based evidence. Nowadays the value of such strong research skills goes beyond the academic field, as translation workplace increasingly values translator’s ability to understand and clearly formulate a problem, systematically select and analyse the evidence, set-up experiments, apply research skills creatively to non-trivial tasks in new areas.

The research colloquium is aimed at supporting students’ preparation of their MA theses. The topic of your written assessment for this course (an essay up to 2000 words) will typically be on the same (broad) topic, as your MA thesis. It will normally cover motivation for the choice of your research topic, your methodology, an outline of your critical literature review and identification of a gap in existing research on the topic. You will be expected to formulate your research problem and research questions, justify its relevance for the field of translation and/or interpreting (e.g., its practical or theoretical value for translators and/or researchers), to identify material for your study and (ideally) present preliminary results of a pilot analysis or experiment. The first weeks of the course will cover an introduction to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research in translation studies. The course will also introduce methods of selecting, sampling, linguistic annotation and statistical analysis of research material for projects in translation studies, methodology of corpus-based translation studies. Later in the course we will focus on student-lead presentations of assigned reading articles and chapters or literature review of the student projects. Students will then be asked to find a supervisor for their MA thesis and to book regular one-to-one tutorials with their prospective supervisors and with the course tutor, leading to presentations of their projects to the class in the final weeks of the course.

*Learning outcomes*: After completing the course the students will be able to orient themselves in modern research methods of Translation Studies, they will be able to formulate and communicate the relevance of their research problem, to link their chosen research topic with an appropriate methodology, materials, literature review, analysis and interpretation of the data, to define the scope and to understand limitations of their approach, and to identify directions for future research.

*Assessment*: An essay or a case study on the topic of their MA thesis, up to 2000 words, to be submitted in 3 weeks after the end of the semester, by 7.03.2021 via Moodle (100% of the final mark for the course).
